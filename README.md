# Codec-Corona-Detector
The two major challenges in diagnosing people with COVID-19 are that symptoms can take up to 2 weeks to show up and the limited number of test kits available in the country. To address this challenge there needs to be a system that can predict those with an infection, but does not show any symptoms. CODEC App deep learning algorithm which is trained with microscopic images of coronavirus got from the infected people. it is to be noted the even the kit that has been invented is too costly and the only professionals can use it and cant be transported in remote places easily. India has over 4,789 confirmed cases of Coronavirus as of 07 April 2020. This number is deceptively low since India has not tested a large number of its population. The current criteria for testing patients in India for Coronavirus are very stringent and tests are conducted only in patients who present multiple symptoms since the codec is a mobile application it has zero investment and can be taken to any place which gives a more accurate result. even police can use this application to check people in each house whether they are affected by corona or not
